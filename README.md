# UDN Submarine Study 1: Honours 2022 Edition

This branch will implement all changes required for two follow-up experiments - fading/TAC and the controls.

## Notes

- Need to do some config to ensure this branch is the ["default" on Pavlovia](https://discourse.psychopy.org/t/ability-to-choose-a-different-branch-for-piloting-on-pavlovia/16202/4)

## TODO

### Required

* [ ] Implement both honours conditions

### Desired (kept from main branch)

* [ ] Check that band space available is possible ahead of time
* [ ] Cooler lookup table
* [ ] Seedable RNG? Have list of known good seeds from which a choice is made. Solves all issues.
* [ ] Prettier "Off" condition
* [ ] Waterfall plot style updates?
* [ ] Other random lines in background?
* [ ] Better highlight colour
